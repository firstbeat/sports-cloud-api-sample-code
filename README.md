# Firstbeat Srpots Cloud API Sample Code

This repository contains sample code how to use Firstbeat Sports Cloud API.

The purpose of these samples is to help understand how to access and use the API. They are not meant to be production-ready, official reference implementations or used as is. 

* We are happy to get feedback about the sample code, but don't provide support.
* These sample codes are for learning purposes only.

## Contents

* `registration/` - Script to assist with registering a new API consumer.
* `auth/` - Standalone scripts to generate JWT tokens (required for API access).
* `quickstart/` - Simple scripts to test connectivity and perform basic queries.

The python sync app is new, not yet properly tested and can contain errors. Use it with caution.
